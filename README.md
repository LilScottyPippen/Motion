<h2>Introduction</h2>
<b>Motion</b> is a free, open source service that provides users with the ability to create notes. It allows you to easily and quickly plan and organize things, which makes their execution as efficient as possible.<br>
<h2>Functionality</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Creating notes</li>
  <li>Editing notes</li>
  <li>Deleting notes</li>
  <li>Search for notes</li>
  <!--
  Future functionality
  <li>Automatic saving of notes when changing</li>
  <li>Ability to add tags to notes for easier search</li>
  <li>Sort notes by creation date and alphabetically</li>
  <li>Exporting notes in PDF format</li>
  -->
</ul>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
I created the Motion project to help people manage their notes more efficiently. Often I notice that people write notes on paper or in various applications, but then lose them or forget about their existence. I believe that Motion will help people keep their notes safe and have access to them at any time.
<h2>Solved problems</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Simplify note management</li>
  <li>Safety and security of notes</li>
  <li>Availability of notes anytime, anywhere</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage examples</h2>
Motion can be used to record any notes - from to-do lists to important information. For example, you can use Motion to record your tasks for the day, to store important contacts, to record ideas for a project, and much more.

<ul>
  <li>Creating a to-do list</li>
  <li>Recording ideas for a project</li>
  <li>Saving recipes</li>
  <li>Educational synopsis</li>
</ul>

<h2>Further development</h2>
I will continue to develop the project by adding new functionality and improving existing ones. For example, I plan to add a feature for sharing notes with other users. I will also improve the design and interface of the service to make it even more user-friendly.
