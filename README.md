<h2>Introduction</h2>
<b>Motion</b> is a free, open source service that provides users with the ability to create notes. It allows you to easily and quickly plan and organize things, which makes their execution as efficient as possible.<br>
The motivation for creating the Motion project was to create a free service with source code that allows users to create notes. This solves the problem of providing a convenient tool for storing notes.<br>
Its difference from other services is open source and ease of use.
